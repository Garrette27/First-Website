        <p>How to write better in business</p>
        <p>Write your ideas in three sentences with complete propositions that convey your ideas then arrange them in the most logical order from the reader's point of view.Know your purpose. Be intensely clear on your purpose. Set the tone and main idea of your message first then gather supporting ideas to your purpose. Make it as simple, emotional and new as possible. Reinforce your purpose on your mind as you write your thoughts. Remember that people needs to be reminded of the main idea more than they need to be instructed. Break down your writing into smaller chunks. Use MACJ method. Gather materials and generate ideas then draw up an outline, however simple then lay your thoughts into words by following Architect plan then polish your thoughts and edit grammar and punctuation in the end.Remember that worrying what to write takes more of your time than writing itself.  </p>

        <p>Help others achieve their goals and they will help you achieve yours</p>
        <p>Humans are born to be preoccupied by the needs and wants of his fellow human beings. Relationships is a bigger motivator than productivity, creating impact and changing the world. Many people think that fame and wealth and achievement were what they needed to go after a good life. But over and over, those who lead a happy, wealthy and long life were the people who leaned into their relationships. 
           Reinforcing your vision of making the customer happy is one of the key behavior of an agent and a team leader. People needs to be reminded more than they need to be instructed, agent needs to be reminded of the value they bring to the table because that is 90 percent of the failure of managers.  </p>
