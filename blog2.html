        <p>How to write better in business</p>
        <p>Write your ideas in three sentences with complete propositions that convey your ideas then arrange them in the most logical order from the reader's point of view.Know your purpose. Be intensely clear on your purpose. Set the tone and main idea of your message first then gather supporting ideas to your purpose. Make it as simple, emotional and new as possible. Reinforce your purpose on your mind as you write your thoughts. Remember that people needs to be reminded of the main idea more than they need to be instructed. Break down your writing into smaller chunks. Use MACJ method. Gather materials and generate ideas then draw up an outline, however simple then lay your thoughts into words by following Architect plan then polish your thoughts and edit grammar and punctuation in the end.Remember that worrying what to write takes more of your time than writing itself.  </p>
