       <p>Help others achieve their goals and they will help you achieve yours</p>
        <p>Humans are born to be preoccupied by the needs and wants of his fellow human beings. Relationships is a bigger motivator than productivity, creating impact and changing the world. Many people think that fame and wealth and achievement were what they needed to go after a good life. But over and over, those who lead a happy, wealthy and long life were the people who leaned into their relationships. 
           Reinforcing your vision of making the customer happy is one of the key behavior of an agent and a team leader. People needs to be reminded more than they need to be instructed, agent needs to be reminded of the value they bring to the table because that is 90 percent of the failure of managers.  </p>
